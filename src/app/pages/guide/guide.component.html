      <p>At AGURI, we offer earth-created and lab-grown diamonds. Both types are the same gemstone with identical
        physical, chemical, and optical properties, differing only in origin. On this page, you will find information
        about how both form and their four key characteristics—carat weight, color, clarity, and cut—that all signify
        value. With this knowledge, you’ll be able to select the diamond that suits you best with confidence and ease.</p>

      <p class="mbt font-weight-bold">How Earth-Created Jewelry Are Formed</p>
      <p>Diamonds are crystalline carbon atoms that formed under the earth’s surface over 3 billion years ago. To be
        more exact, they formed in the earth’s mantle about 90 miles below the surface under temperatures as high as
        2000° F and a pressure of 45-60 kilobars. These extreme conditions link the diamond's atoms together in a
        special way, creating the hardest substance on earth.</p>
      <p>After their formations, diamonds reach the earth’s surface during extremely rare and not yet observed
        deep-source volcanic eruptions. Diamond is the only gemstone composed of a single element, as they are
        typically about 99.95% carbon. The other 0.05% can include one or more trace elements, which are atoms that
        aren’t part of a diamond’s essential chemistry. Some of them influence color.</p>

      <h4 class="mbt">Lab - grown Jewellery</h4>
      <p class="mbt font-weight-bold">How Earth-Created Jewelry Are Formed</p>
      <p>Lab-grown jewelery are real diamonds grown in man-made environments. Current technology can recreate conditions
        necessary for a diamond crystal to form, replicating the earth's natural process of diamond formation.</p>
      <p>There are two common methods for growing diamonds in a lab: High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) and
        Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD).An HPHT diamond starts as a small diamond seed that is placed into carbon.
        Exposed to about 1500 degrees Celsius and pressurized to approximately 1.5 million pounds per square inch,
        the pure carbon melts and begins to form around the starter seed. It is then carefully cooled to form a pure
        carbon diamond.In the CVD method, a diamond seed is placed in carbon rich gasses that are ionized into plasma
        using technology similar to that of microwaves and lasers.</p>

      <p class="mbt">Once the lab-grown or earth-created diamond is selected, the next step is to choose the quality of the diamond
        and the shape of its cut. Both types of diamonds are graded by gemological institutes following exactly the same
        process and are cut using exactly the same standards. To help guide your process, you can learn about diamond
        grading and certification, the 4 C’s, diamond shapes, and more, below.</p>
