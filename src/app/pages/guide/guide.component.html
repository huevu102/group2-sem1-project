          <p class="mb-2 smt">Lab-grown jewelery are real diamonds grown in man-made environments. Current technology can recreate conditions
            necessary for a diamond crystal to form, replicating the earth's natural process of diamond formation.</p>
          <p class="smt">There are two common methods for growing diamonds in a lab: High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) and
            Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD).An HPHT diamond starts as a small diamond seed that is placed into carbon.
            Exposed to about 1500 degrees Celsius and pressurized to approximately 1.5 million pounds per square inch,
            the pure carbon melts and begins to form around the starter seed. It is then carefully cooled to form a pure
            carbon diamond.In the CVD method, a diamond seed is placed in carbon rich gasses that are ionized into plasma
            using technology similar to that of microwaves and lasers.</p>

          <p class="mdt my-3">How Earth-Created Jewelry Are Formed</p>
          <p class="mb-2 smt">Diamonds are crystalline carbon atoms that formed under the earth’s surface over 3 billion years ago. To be
            more exact, they formed in the earth’s mantle about 90 miles below the surface under temperatures as high as
            2000° F and a pressure of 45-60 kilobars. These extreme conditions link the diamond's atoms together in a
            special way, creating the hardest substance on earth.</p>
          <p class="smt">After their formations, diamonds reach the earth’s surface during extremely rare and not yet observed
            deep-source volcanic eruptions. Diamond is the only gemstone composed of a single element, as they are
            typically about 99.95% carbon. The other 0.05% can include one or more trace elements, which are atoms that
            aren’t part of a diamond’s essential chemistry. Some of them influence color.</p>

        <p>Once the lab-grown or earth-created diamond is selected, the next step is to choose the quality of the diamond
          and the shape of its cut. Both types of diamonds are graded by gemological institutes following exactly the same
          process and are cut using exactly the same standards. To help guide your process, you can learn about diamond
          grading and certification, the 4 C’s, diamond shapes, and more, below.</p>

                <p>Diamond carat (ct) refers to a diamond’s weight. The most common and popular diamonds in the jewelry
                  industry range up to 1 carat. Prices increase exponentially as the diamond's weight increases, as larger
                  diamond crystals over 1 carat are more difficult to find.</p>
                <p>Diamond cutters today use advanced technology to achieve the best proportions, ensuring that each diamond
                  is cut following similar ratios. This allows them to estimate the diamond's diameter based on its carat weight.
                  Though this is still an approximation, it can help you identify the best carat weight for your desired size.</p>

                <p>Gemological institutes grade white diamonds based on the absence of color. Though diamonds are primarily
                  carbon, they often include trace elements that can affect their color. The most common trace element is
                  nitrogen, which gives off a subtle shade of yellow. The richer the yellow hue, the more common the diamond crystal, which decreases their value.</p>
                <p>To grade white diamond color, gemological institutes use letters of the alphabet, starting from D
                  (colorless) all the way to Z (light yellow). Truly colorless diamonds are quite rare, therefore are
                  the most expensive. However, you should note that subtle hints of color are difficult to spot outside
                  of a laboratory environment. The most common color ranges are D through F and G through J.</p>
